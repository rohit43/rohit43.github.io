  abstract     = {Tuberculosis continues to be a major health challenge,
                  warranting the need for newer strategies for therapeutic
                  intervention and newer approaches to discover them. Here, we
                  report the identification of efficient metabolism disruption
                  strategies by analysis of a reactome network. Protein-protein
                  dependencies at a genome scale are derived from the curated
                  metabolic network, from which insights into the nature and
                  extent of inter-protein and inter-pathway dependencies have
                  been obtained. A functional distance matrix and a subsequent
                  nearness index derived from this information, helps in
                  understanding how the influence of a given protein can pervade
                  to the metabolic network. Thus, the nearness index can be
                  viewed as a metabolic disruptability index, which suggests
                  possible strategies for achieving maximal metabolic disruption
                  by inhibition of the least number of proteins. A greedy
                  approach has been used to identify the most influential
                  singleton, and its combination with the other most pervasive
                  proteins to obtain highly influential pairs, triplets and
                  quadruplets. The effect of deletion of these combinations on
                  cellular metabolism has been studied by flux balance analysis.
                  An obvious outcome of this study is a rational identification
                  of drug targets, to efficiently bring down mycobacterial
                  metabolism.},

  abstract     = {Emergence of drug resistance is a major problem in the
                  treatment of many diseases including tuberculosis. To tackle
                  the problem from a wholistic perspective, it is essential to
                  understand the molecular mechanisms by which bacteria acquire
                  drug resistance using a systems approach. Availability of
                  genome-scale data of expression profiles under different drug
                  exposed conditions and protein-protein interactions, makes it
                  feasible to reconstruct and analyze systems-level models. A
                  number of proteins involved in different resistance
                  mechanisms, referred to as the resistome are identified from
                  literature. The interaction of the drug directly with the
                  resistome is unable to explain most resistance processes
                  adequately, including that of increased mutations in the
                  target's binding site. We recently hypothesized that some
                  communication might exist from the drug environment to the
                  resistome to trigger emergence of drug resistance. We report
                  here a network based approach to identify most plausible paths
                  of such communication in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Networks
                  capturing both structural and functional linkages among
                  various proteins were weighted based on gene expression
                  profiles upon exposure to specific drugs and betweenness
                  centrality of the interactions. Our analysis suggests that
                  different drug targets and hence different drugs could trigger
                  the resistome to different extents and through different
                  routes. The identified paths correlate well with the
                  mechanisms known through experiment. Some examples of the top
                  ranked hubs in multiple drug specific networks are PolA,
                  FadD1, CydA, a monoxygenase and GltS, which could serve as
                  co-targets, that could be inhibited in order to retard
                  resistance related communication in the cell.},

  abstract     = {UNLABELLED: Complex biological systems exhibit a property of
                  robustness at all levels of organization. Through different
                  mechanisms, the system tries to sustain stress such as due to
                  starvation or drug exposure. To explore whether
                  reconfiguration of the metabolic networks is used as a means
                  to achieve robustness, we have studied possible metabolic
                  adjustments in Mtb upon exposure to isoniazid (INH), a
                  front-line clinical drug. The redundancy in the genome of M.
                  tuberculosis (Mtb) makes it an attractive system to explore if
                  alternate routes of metabolism exist in the bacterium. While
                  the mechanism of action of INH is well studied, its effect on
                  the overall metabolism is not well characterized. Using flux
                  balance analysis, inhibiting the fluxes flowing through the
                  reactions catalyzed by Rv1484, the target of INH,
                  significantly changes the overall flux profiles. At the
                  pathway level, activation or inactivation of certain pathways
                  distant from the target pathway, are seen. Metabolites such as
                  NADPH are shown to reduce drastically, while fatty acids tend
                  to accumulate. The overall biomass also decreases with
                  increasing inhibition levels. Inhibition studies, pathway
                  level clustering and comparison of the flux profiles with the
                  gene expression data indicate the activation of folate
                  metabolism, ubiquinone metabolism, and metabolism of certain
                  amino acids. This analysis provides insights useful for target
                  identification and designing strategies for combination
                  therapy. Insights gained about the role of individual
                  components of a system and their interactions will also
                  provide a basis for reconstruction of whole systems through
                  synthetic biology approaches. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY

  abstract     = {A decade since the availability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
                  (Mtb) genome sequence, no promising drug has seen the light of
                  the day. This not only indicates the challenges in discovering
                  new drugs but also suggests a gap in our current understanding
                  of Mtb biology. We attempt to bridge this gap by carrying out
                  extensive re-annotation and constructing a systems level
                  protein interaction map of Mtb with an objective of finding
                  novel drug target candidates. Towards this, we synergized
                  crowd sourcing and social networking methods through an
                  initiative 'Connect to Decode' (C2D) to generate the first and
                  largest manually curated interactome of Mtb termed
                  'interactome pathway' (IPW), encompassing a total of 1434
                  proteins connected through 2575 functional relationships.
                  Interactions leading to gene regulation, signal transduction,
                  metabolism, structural complex formation have been catalogued.
                  In the process, we have functionally annotated 87\% of the Mtb
                  genome in context of gene products. We further combine IPW
                  with STRING based network to report central proteins, which
                  may be assessed as potential drug targets for development of
                  drugs with least possible side effects. The fact that five of
                  the 17 predicted drug targets are already experimentally
                  validated either genetically or biochemically lends credence
                  to our unique approach.},

               represents a given biological process presents a fundamental
               challenge in the network science of biology. The quality of
               network for the organism of interest is critically dependent on
               the extent of functional annotation of its genome. Mostly the

               information present in volumes of literature and hence large

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of current therapeutic regimens
                  for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is diminished by the need
                  for prolonged therapy and the rise of drug resistant/tolerant
                  strains. This global health threat, despite decades of basic
                  research and a wealth of legacy knowledge, is due to a lack of
                  systems level understanding that can innovate the process of
                  fast acting and high efficacy drug discovery. METHODS: The
                  enhanced functional annotations of the Mtb genome, which were
                  previously obtained through a crowd sourcing approach was used
                  to reconstruct the metabolic network of Mtb in a bottom up
                  manner. We represent this information by developing a novel
                  Systems Biology Spindle Map of Metabolism (SBSM) and
                  comprehend its static and dynamic structure using various
                  computational approaches based on simulation and design.
                  RESULTS: The reconstructed metabolism of Mtb encompasses 961
                  metabolites, involved in 1152 reactions catalyzed by 890
                  protein coding genes, organized into 50 pathways. By
                  accounting for static and dynamic analysis of SBSM in Mtb we
                  identified various critical proteins required for the growth
                  and survival of bacteria. Further, we assessed the potential
                  of these proteins as putative drug targets that are fast
                  acting and less toxic. Further, we formulate a novel concept
                  of metabolic persister genes (MPGs) and compared our
                  predictions with published in vitro and in vivo experimental
                  evidence. Through such analyses, we report for the first time
                  that de novo biosynthesis of NAD may give rise to bacterial
                  persistence in Mtb under conditions of metabolic stress
                  induced by conventional anti-tuberculosis therapy. We propose
                  such MPG's as potential combination of drug targets for
                  existing antibiotics that can improve their efficacy and
                  efficiency for drug tolerant bacteria. CONCLUSION: The systems
                  level framework formulated by us to identify potential
                  non-toxic drug targets and strategies to circumvent the issue
                  of bacterial persistence can substantially aid in the process
                  of TB drug discovery and translational research.},

                  treatment option for type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains ambiguous.
                  The availability of electronic medical records and insurance
                  claims data, which capture routine medical practice, accessed
                  via the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics
                  network presents an opportunity to generate evidence for the
                  effectiveness of second-line treatments. Objective: To
                  identify which drug classes among sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl
                  peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones are
                  associated with reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and
                  lower risk of myocardial infarction, kidney disorders, and eye
                  disorders in patients with T2D treated with metformin as a
                  first-line therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Three
                  retrospective, propensity-matched, new-user cohort studies
                  with replication across 8 sites were performed from 1975 to
                  2017. Medical data of 246 558 805 patients from multiple
                  countries from the Observational Health Data Sciences and
                  Informatics (OHDSI) initiative were included and medical data
                  sets were transformed into a unified common data model, with
                  analysis done using open-source analytical tools. Participants
                  included patients with T2D receiving metformin with at least 1
                  prior HbA1c laboratory test who were then prescribed either
                  sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones. Data
                  analysis was conducted from 2015 to 2018. Exposures: Treatment
                  with sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones
                  starting at least 90 days after the initial prescription of
                  metformin. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome is
                  the first observation of the reduction of HbA1c level to 7\%
                  of total hemoglobin or less after prescription of a
                  second-line drug. Secondary outcomes are myocardial
                  infarction, kidney disorder, and eye disorder after
                  prescription of a second-line drug. Results: A total of 246
                  558 805 patients (126 977 785 women [51.5\%]) were analyzed.
                  Effectiveness of sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, and
                  thiazolidinediones prescribed after metformin to lower HbA1c
                  level to 7\% or less of total hemoglobin remained
                  indistinguishable in patients with T2D. Patients treated with
                  sulfonylureas compared with DPP-4 inhibitors had a small
                  increased consensus hazard ratio of myocardial infarction
                  (1.12; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.24) and eye disorders (1.15; 95\% CI,
                  1.11-1.19) in the meta-analysis. Hazard of observing kidney
                  disorders after treatment with sulfonylureas, DPP-4
                  inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones was equally likely.
                  Conclusions and Relevance: The examined drug classes did not
                  differ in lowering HbA1c and in hazards of kidney disorders in
                  patients with T2D treated with metformin as a first-line
                  therapy. Sulfonylureas had a small, higher observed hazard of
                  myocardial infarction and eye disorders compared with DPP-4
                  inhibitors in the meta-analysis. The OHDSI collaborative
                  network can be used to conduct a large international study
                  examining the effectiveness of second-line treatment choices
                  made in clinical management of T2D.},

                  An urban district TB centre in India under the Revised
                  National Tuberculosis Control Programme. PARTICIPANTS: A
                  cohort of 123 patients who started DRTB treatment between June
                  2010 and May 2013. METHODS: Patients started on treatment for
                  DRTB between June 2010 and May 2013 who were provided with the
                  integrated support package for at least 3 months formed the
                  supported group while the other patients of the cohort formed
                  the non-supported group. The treatment outcomes and sputum
                  culture conversion rates were compared between the two groups.
                  RESULTS: The supported group consisted of 60 patients and the
                  non-supported group of 63 patients. The treatment success rate
                  was found to be significantly higher in the supported group
                  (65\% vs 46.03\%; p=0.0349). Support duration was
                  significantly associated with lower incidence of death [HR
                  0.876, 95\% CI 0.811-0.947; p=0.0009] and loss to follow up
                  [OR: 0.752, 95\% CI 0.597-0.873; p=0.0023]. The treatment
                  failure rate was higher in the supported group (16.66\% vs
                  4.76\%) with 60\% of the failures in the supported group
                  occurring after 24 months of compliant treatment. There was no
                  significant association found between support duration and
                  treatment failure or sputum culture conversion. CONCLUSION:
                  Integrated support seems to significantly increase the
                  treatment success rate and improve survival and treatment
                  adherence of DRTB patients. However, early diagnosis and
                  effective pharmacotherapy are crucial for reducing treatment
                  failures.},

                  diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis
                  (ATB) disease and for predicting the progression from latent

                  evaluate their performance against the WHO/FIND TPPs. METHODS
                  AND FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, Gene Expression Omnibus
                  (GEO), and ArrayExpress in June 2018. We included all studies
                  irrespective of study design and enrollment criteria. We found
                  16 gene signatures for the diagnosis of ATB compared to other
                  clinical conditions in PubMed. For each signature, we
                  implemented a classification model as described in the
                  corresponding original publication of the signature. We
                  identified 24 datasets containing 3,083 transcriptome profiles
                  from whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples
                  of healthy controls or patients with ATB, LTBI, or other
                  diseases from 14 countries in GEO. Using these datasets, we
                  calculated weighted mean area under the receiver operating
                  characteristic curve (AUROC), specificity at 90\% sensitivity,
                  and negative predictive value (NPV) for each gene signature
                  across all datasets. We also compared the diagnostic odds
                  ratio (DOR), heterogeneity in DOR, and false positive rate
                  (FPR) for each signature using bivariate meta-analysis. Across
                  9 datasets of patients with culture-confirmed diagnosis of
                  ATB, 11 signatures had weighted mean AUROC > 0.8, and 2
                  signatures had weighted mean AUROC ≤ 0.6. All but 2 signatures
                  had high NPV (>98\% at 2\% prevalence). Two gene signatures
                  achieved the minimal WHO TPP for a non-sputum-based triage
                  test. When including datasets with clinical diagnosis of ATB,
                  there was minimal reduction in the weighted mean AUROC and
                  specificity of all but 3 signatures compared to when using
                  only culture-confirmed ATB data. Only 4 signatures had
                  homogeneous DOR and lower FPR when datasets with clinical
                  diagnosis of ATB were included; other signatures either had
                  heterogeneous DOR or higher FPR or both. Finally, 7 of 16 gene
                  signatures predicted progression from LTBI to ATB 6 months
                  prior to sputum conversion with positive predictive value >
                  6\% at 2\% prevalence. Our analyses may have under- or
                  overestimated the performance of certain ATB diagnostic
                  signatures because our implementation may be different from
                  the published models for those signatures. We re-implemented
                  published models because the exact models were not publicly
                  available. CONCLUSIONS: We found that host-response-based
                  diagnostics could accurately identify patients with ATB and
                  predict individuals with high risk of progression from LTBI to
                  ATB prior to sputum conversion. We found that a higher number
                  of genes in a signature did not increase the accuracy of the
                  signature. Overall, the Sweeney3 signature performed robustly
                  across all comparisons. Our results provide strong evidence
                  for the potential of host-response-based diagnostics in
                  achieving the WHO goal of ending tuberculosis by 2035, and
                  host-response-based diagnostics should be pursued for clinical
                  implementation.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after
                  cerebral infarction is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon
                  in the acute stage of ischemic stroke, and often results in a
                  poor prognosis. Thus, identifying risk factors and making an
                  early prediction of HT in acute cerebral infarction
                  contributes not only to the selections of therapeutic regimen
                  but also, more importantly, to the improvement of prognosis of
                  acute cerebral infarction. The purpose of this study was to
                  develop and validate a model to predict a patient's risk of HT
                  within 30 days of initial ischemic stroke. METHODS: We
                  utilized a retrospective multicenter observational cohort
                  study design to develop a Lasso Logistic Regression prediction
                  model with a large, US Electronic Health Record dataset which
                  structured to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
                  (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). To examine clinical
                  transportability, the model was externally validated across 10
                  additional real-world healthcare datasets include EHR records
                  for patients from America, Europe and Asia. RESULTS: In the
                  database the model was developed, the target population cohort
                  contained 621,178 patients with ischemic stroke, of which
                  5,624 patients had HT within 30 days following initial
                  ischemic stroke. 612 risk predictors, including the distance a
                  patient travels in an ambulance to get to care for a HT, were
                  identified. An area under the receiver operating
                  characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 was achieved in the
                  internal validation of the risk model. External validation was
                  performed across 10 databases totaling 5,515,508 patients with
                  ischemic stroke, of which 86,401 patients had HT within 30
                  days following initial ischemic stroke. The mean external AUC
                  was 0.71 and ranged between 0.60-0.78. CONCLUSIONS: A HT
                  prognostic predict model was developed with Lasso Logistic
                  Regression based on routinely collected EMR data. This model
                  can identify patients who have a higher risk of HT than the
                  population average with an AUC of 0.78. It shows the OMOP CDM
                  is an appropriate data standard for EMR secondary use in
                  clinical multicenter research for prognostic prediction model
                  development and validation. In the future, combining this
                  model with clinical information systems will assist clinicians
                  to make the right therapy decision for patients with acute
                  ischemic stroke.},

  abstract     = {PURPOSE: Patients with cancer are predisposed to developing
                  chronic, comorbid conditions that affect prognosis, quality of
                  life, and mortality. While treatment guidelines and care
                  variations for these comorbidities have been described for the
                  general noncancer population, less is known about real-world
                  treatment patterns in patients with cancer. We sought to
                  characterize the prevalence and distribution of initial
                  treatment patterns across a large-scale data network for
                  depression, hypertension, and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
                  among patients with cancer. METHODS: We used the Observational
                  Health Data Sciences and Informatics network, an international
                  collaborative implementing the Observational Medical Outcomes
                  Partnership Common Data Model to standardize more than 2
                  billion patient records. For this study, we used 8 databases
                  across 3 countries-the United States, France, and Germany-with
                  295,529,655 patient records. We identified patients with
                  cancer using SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine)
                  codes validated via manual review. We then characterized the
                  treatment patterns of these patients initiating treatment of
                  depression, hypertension, or T2DM with persistent treatment
                  and at least 365 days of observation. RESULTS: Across
                  databases, wide variations exist in treatment patterns for
                  depression (n = 1,145,510), hypertension (n = 3,178,944), and
                  T2DM (n = 886,766). When limited to 6-node (6-drug) sequences,
                  we identified 61,052 unique sequences for depression, 346,067
                  sequences for hypertension, and 40,629 sequences for T2DM.
                  These variations persisted across sites, databases, countries,
                  and conditions, with the exception of metformin (73.8\%) being
                  the most common initial T2DM treatment. The most common
                  initial medications were sertraline (17.5\%) and escitalopram
                  (17.5\%) for depression and hydrochlorothiazide (20.5\%) and
                  lisinopril (19.6\%) for hypertension. CONCLUSION: We
                  identified wide variations in the treatment of common
                  comorbidities in patients with cancer, similar to the general
                  population, and demonstrate the feasibility of conducting
                  research on patients with cancer across a large-scale
                  observational data network using a common data model.},

  abstract     = {There is an urgent need to identify therapies that prevent
                  SARS-CoV-2 infection and improve the outcome of COVID-19
                  patients. Although repurposed drugs with favorable safety
                  profiles could have significant benefit, widely available
                  prevention or treatment options for COVID-19 have yet to be
                  identified. Efforts to identify approved drugs with in vitro
                  activity against SARS-CoV-2 resulted in identification of
                  antiviral sigma-1 receptor ligands, including antihistamines
                  in the histamine-1 receptor binding class. We identified
                  antihistamine candidates for repurposing by mining electronic
                  health records of usage in population of more than 219,000
                  subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2. Usage of diphenhydramine,
                  hydroxyzine and azelastine was associated with reduced
                  incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in subjects greater than
                  age 61. We found diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine and azelastine
                  to exhibit direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in
                  vitro. Although mechanisms by which specific antihistamines
                  exert antiviral effects is not clear, hydroxyzine, and
                  possibly azelastine, bind Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2
                  (ACE2) and the sigma-1 receptor as off-targets. Clinical
                  studies are needed to measure the effectiveness of
                  diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine and azelastine for disease
                  prevention, for early intervention, or as adjuvant therapy for
                  severe COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {37 Background: SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is facilitated
                  by the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2. TMPRSS2 expression can
                  be modulated by the androgen receptor. It is unclear whether
                  androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may partially protect from
                  SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: A retrospective registry study
                  of adult men with prostate cancer who underwent testing for
                  SARS-CoV-2 in the UC Health System between February 1, 2020
                  and October 6, 2020 was performed. The University of
                  California Health COVID Research Data Set (UC CORDS), which
                  includes electronic health data of all patients who underwent
                  testing for SARS-CoV-2 at 5 UC academic medical centers (UC
                  Davis, UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, and UC San
                  Francisco) and 12 affiliated hospitals across California, was
                  used. Association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and receipt of ADT
                  (GnRH agonist or antagonist) within 90 days of COVID testing
                  was determined using the Chi-Squared test. Analyses
                  (Chi-Squared or Fisher’s exact tests) were also performed in
                  race/ethnicity subgroups. Results: Overall, 2,948 men with
                  prostate cancer who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing were
                  identified, of whom 59 (2.0\%) tested positive. Of the 2,948
                  men, 2,124 (72\%) were White; 219 (7\%) Black or
                  African-American; 182 (6\%) Asian or Native
                  Hawaiian/Pacific-Islander; 176 (6\%) Other race; and 247 (8\%)
                  Unknown race. There were 235 (8\%) Hispanic or Latino men.
                  Among the 444 men who received ADT in the entire cohort, 7
                  (1.6\%) tested positive, and among the 2,504 men who did not
                  receive ADT, 52 (2.1\%) tested positive (OR 0.76, 95\% CI
                  0.34-1.67, P = 0.49). No statistically significant association
                  between ADT and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was found within race or
                  ethnicity subgroups. Conclusions: No association between the
                  use of ADT and the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was
                  identified in this study of a diverse patient population in
                  the University of California Health System medical centers and
                  hospitals. In this setting of an overall low prevalence of
                  SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus far, there is no strong evidence of
                  a protective benefit of ADT.},

  abstract     = {Much scientific work over the past few decades has linked
                  health outcomes and disease risk to genomics, to derive a
                  better understanding of disease mechanisms at the genetic and
                  molecular level. However, genomics alone does not quite
                  capture the full picture of one's overall health. Modern
                  computational biomedical research is moving in the direction
                  of including social/environmental factors that ultimately
                  affect quality of life and health outcomes at both the
                  population and individual level. The future of studying
                  disease now lies at the hands of the social determinants of
                  health (SDOH) to answer pressing clinical questions and
                  address healthcare disparities across population groups
                  through its integration into electronic health records (EHRs).
                  In this perspective article, we argue that the SDOH are the
                  future of disease risk and health outcomes studies due to
                  their vast coverage of a patient's overall health. SDOH data
                  availability in EHRs has improved tremendously over the years
                  with EHR toolkits, diagnosis codes, wearable devices, and
                  census tract information to study disease risk. We discuss the
                  availability of SDOH data, challenges in SDOH implementation,
                  its future in real-world evidence studies, and the next steps
                  to report study outcomes in an equitable and actionable way.},

  abstract     = {Chronic low back pain (cLBP) afflicts 8. 2\% of adults in the
                  United States, and is the leading global cause of disability.
                  Neuropsychiatric co-morbidities including anxiety, depression,
                  and substance abuse- are common in cLBP patients. In
                  particular, cLBP is a risk factor for opioid addiction, as
                  more than 50\% of opioid prescriptions in the United States
                  are for cLBP. Misuse of these prescriptions is a common
                  precursor to addiction. While associations between cLBP and
                  neuropsychiatric disorders are well established, causal
                  relationships for the most part are unknown. Developing
                  effective treatments for cLBP, and associated co-morbidities,
                  requires identifying and understanding causal relationships.
                  Rigorous methods for causal inference, a process for
                  quantifying causal effects from observational data, have been
                  developed over the past 30 years. In this review we first
                  discuss the conceptual model of cLBP that current treatments
                  are based on, and how gaps in causal knowledge contribute to
                  poor clinical outcomes. We then present cLBP as a "Big Data"
                  problem and identify how advanced analytic techniques may
                  close knowledge gaps and improve clinical outcomes. We will
                  focus on causal discovery, which is a data-driven method that
                  uses artificial intelligence (AI) and high dimensional
                  datasets to identify causal structures, discussing both
                  constraint-based (PC and Fast Causal Inference) and
                  score-based (Fast Greedy Equivalent Search) algorithms.},

                  tests under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) must be
                  assessed. We describe overall trends in the performance of
                  serology tests in the context of real-world implementation.
                  METHODS: Six health systems estimated the odds of
                  seropositivity and positive percent agreement (PPA) of
                  serology test among people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
                  by molecular test. In each dataset, we present the odds ratio
                  and PPA, overall and by key clinical, demographic, and
                  practice parameters. RESULTS: A total of 15,615 people were
                  observed to have at least one serology test 14-90 days after a
                  positive molecular test for SARS-CoV-2. We observed higher PPA
                  in Hispanic (PPA range: 79-96\%) compared to non-Hispanic
                  (60-89\%) patients; in those presenting with at least one
                  COVID-19 related symptom (69-93\%) as compared to no such
                  symptoms (63-91\%); and in inpatient (70-97\%) and emergency
                  department (93-99\%) compared to outpatient (63-92\%) settings
                  across datasets. PPA was highest in those with diabetes
                  (75-94\%) and kidney disease (83-95\%); and lowest in those
                  with auto-immune conditions or who are immunocompromised
                  (56-93\%). The odds ratios (OR) for seropositivity were higher
                  in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics (OR range: 2.59-3.86),
                  patients with diabetes (1.49-1.56), and obesity (1.63-2.23);
                  and lower in those with immunocompromised or autoimmune
                  conditions (0.25-0.70), as compared to those without those
                  comorbidities. In a subset of three datasets with robust
                  information on serology test name, seven tests were used, two
                  of which were used in multiple settings and met the EUA
                  requirement of PPA ≥87\%. Tests performed similarly across
                  datasets. CONCLUSION: Although the EUA requirement was not
                  consistently met, more investigation is needed to understand
                  how serology and molecular tests are used, including
                  indication and protocol fidelity. Improved data
                  interoperability of test and clinical/demographic data are
                  needed to enable rapid assessment of the real-world
                  performance of in vitro diagnostic tests.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: As diagnostic tests for COVID-19 were broadly
                  deployed under Emergency Use Authorization, there emerged a
                  need to understand the real-world utilization and performance
                  of serological testing across the United States. METHODS: Six
                  health systems contributed electronic health records and/or
                  claims data, jointly developed a master protocol, and used it
                  to execute the analysis in parallel. We used descriptive
                  statistics to examine demographic, clinical, and geographic
                  characteristics of serology testing among patients with RNA
                  positive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Across datasets, we observed
                  930,669 individuals with positive RNA for SARS-CoV-2. Of
                  these, 35,806 (4\%) were serotested within 90 days; 15\% of
                  which occurred 30\%) in some datasets-limiting our ability to
                  examine differences in serological testing by race. In
                  datasets where race/ethnicity information was available, we
                  observed a greater distribution of White individuals among
                  those serotested; however, the time between RNA and serology
                  tests appeared shorter in Black compared to White individuals.
                  Test manufacturer data was available in half of the datasets
                  contributing to the analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results inform
                  the underlying context of serotesting during the first year of
                  the COVID-19 pandemic and differences observed between claims
                  and EHR data sources-a critical first step to understanding
                  the real-world accuracy of serological tests. Incomplete
                  reporting of race/ethnicity data and a limited ability to link
                  test manufacturer data, lab results, and clinical data
                  challenge the ability to assess the real-world performance of
                  SARS-CoV-2 tests in different contexts and the overall U.S.
                  response to current and future disease pandemics.},

  abstract     = {Background: Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were
                  pre-specified to be monitored for the COVID-19 vaccines. Some
                  AESIs are not only associated with the vaccines, but with
                  COVID-19. Our aim was to characterise the incidence rates of
                  AESIs following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and compare
                  these to historical rates in the general population. Methods:
                  A multi-national cohort study with data from primary care,
                  electronic health records, and insurance claims mapped to a
                  common data model. This study's evidence was collected between
                  Jan 1, 2017 and the conclusion of each database (which ranged
                  from Jul 2020 to May 2022). The 16 pre-specified prevalent
                  AESIs were: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis,
                  appendicitis, Bell's palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated
                  intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain- Barré
                  syndrome, haemorrhagic stroke, non-haemorrhagic stroke, immune
                  thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy,
                  pulmonary embolism, transverse myelitis, and thrombosis with
                  thrombocytopenia. Age-sex standardised incidence rate ratios
                  (SIR) were estimated to compare post-COVID-19 to pre-pandemic
                  rates in each of the databases. Findings: Substantial
                  heterogeneity by age was seen for AESI rates, with some
                  clearly increasing with age but others following the opposite
                  trend. Similarly, differences were also observed across
                  databases for same health outcome and age-sex strata. All
                  studied AESIs appeared consistently more common in the
                  post-COVID-19 compared to the historical cohorts, with related
                  meta-analytic SIRs ranging from 1.32 (1.05 to 1.66) for
                  narcolepsy to 11.70 (10.10 to 13.70) for pulmonary embolism.
                  Interpretation: Our findings suggest all AESIs are more common
                  after COVID-19 than in the general population. Thromboembolic
                  events were particularly common, and over 10-fold more so.
                  More research is needed to contextualise post-COVID-19
                  complications in the longer term. Funding: None.},

                  data across a multicenter health care system? Findings This
                  cohort study including 31 852 patients with diabetes monitored
                  for 5 years and using clinical data analysis found that
                  treatment with either a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
                  agonist, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, or
                  dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor added to metformin
                  monotherapy was effective compared with a sulfonylurea in
                  maintaining glycemic control, with glucagon-like peptide-1
                  receptor agonist being more effective than dipeptidyl

                  with fewer diabetes-related cardiovascular and renal
