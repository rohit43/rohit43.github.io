I'm a clinical data scientist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). I work at the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute and in the Pediatrics department at the School of Medicine. I'm also part of the UCSF Center for Real World Evidence team, working under Prof. Atul Butte. I obtained Ph.D in biomedical science from the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research in New Delhi, India, and Bachelor of Engineering in Biotechnology from Acharya Institute of Technology in Bangalore, India. I completed post-doctoral work at Stanford University.

My research focuses on using real-world clinical data to generate meaningful evidence. I use methods from causal inference and machine learning, including large language models, to inform medical and policy decisions. Right now, I'm developing a framework to simulate clinical trials for comparing treatment effectiveness. This work uses real-world clinical data from UCSF and across the University of California Health System (UC Health). Our aim is to use this framework to compare different drugs and digital therapies for post-market monitoring.

I also help assess and maintain quality standards for the UCSF and UC Health data warehouse, which uses the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcome Partnership) format. In the Butte lab, I mentor PhD students and postdocs.

My work is currently [funded](/projects/) by the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute and several FDA offices: the Office of Commissioner, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the Office of Women's Health, and the Oncology Center of Excellence. This funding comes through the UCSF-Stanford CERSI program.
