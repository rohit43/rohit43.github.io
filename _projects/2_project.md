##### [Project Description & Goals _â†—_](https://www.fda.gov/science-research/advancing-regulatory-science/real-world-population-characteristics-safety-and-effectiveness-covid-19-vaccines)

The goal of this study is to analyze COVID-19 related RWD for potential adverse events (AE) after COVID-19 vaccination. UCSF-Stanford CERSI will collaborate with partners within the FDA Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST)External Link Disclaimer initiative and IBM to characterize the association between adverse events (AE) and COVID-19 vaccine exposure. This will be done by analyzing EHR data collected from over 8 million patients accessing care at the University of California Health (UC Health) system. Researchers will determine the extent to which the UC Health population can be used to understand COVID-19 vaccine-associated AE in the general population. Frequency of AE prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and after vaccination will be determined. EHR data will also be used to develop novel methods for identifying and characterizing AE. Demographics of the vaccinated UC Health population will be described using characteristics such as sex, age, and race. Methods will be used to describe the socioeconomic profile of the UC Health population and to assess the impact of socioeconomic conditions on the frequency of AE post-COVID-19 vaccination.
