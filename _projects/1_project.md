##### [Project Description & Goals **â†—**](https://www.fda.gov/science-research/advancing-regulatory-science/learning-real-world-sex-specific-clinical-factors-influencing-susceptibility-infection-immune)

In this project, we aim to identify important clinical factors with a systematic analysis of the real-world clinical data of over half a million patients receiving COVID-19 related care across UC Health. We will then confirm our findings using the nationwide COVID-19 data from the NIH-N3C collaborative cohort of over 10 million individuals tested or treated for COVID-19. The UC Health system treats patients in the general population across 6 academic health centers and 12 hospitals, with approximately 150,000 inpatient and 4 million outpatient visits yearly. We will use the UC Health COVID Research Dataset (UC CORDS) as our training and testing data set and validate our findings using the nationwide COVID-19 dataset from the NIH-N3C collaborative. Both the UC CORDS and NIH-N3C collaborative structure their underlying clinical data using a standardized common data model. We, therefore, aim to develop, test, and validate our analysis based on both the datasets and make our computer program available to the public to enable further research.
