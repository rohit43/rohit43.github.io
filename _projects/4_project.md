##### [Project Description & Goals _â†—_](https://www.fda.gov/science-research/advancing-regulatory-science/rapid-query-model-address-prioritized-covid-19-questions-using-ehr-data)

UC Health, comprised of 19 health professional schools, 5 academic medical centers, and 12 hospitals, has built a secure central data warehouse of 7 million patient records. Patients documented within this central data warehouse receive care both within and outside the state of California. UC Health created a standardized Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Limited Data Set called the UC COVID Research Data Set (UC CORDS) soon after the COVID-19 pandemic began. The UC CORDS database captures medical information related to patients infected with COVID-19 and various aspects of their medical care. UC Health uses UC CORDS to rapidly answer questions posed by the FDA. The rapid-query model is a multi-step framework comprised of a computational pipeline used to rapidly query UC CORDS and refine the quality of the questions being asked by conducting follow-up statistical analysis. UC Health proposes to deliver preliminary answers to COVID-19 questions within 2-4 days of the question transmittal, and more detailed answers within two weeks of the finally refined question. Answers are delivered in regular reports accompanied by tables of counts and data visualizations.
